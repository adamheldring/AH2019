### We are proud to announce that Los Angeles based publishing company Media Horse will represent Adam Heldring for synchronization licensing in the United States. 

There is a deal in place concerning the entire Adam Heldring song catalogue including the unreleased upcoming album.

Synchronization licensing is the part of music publishing that deals with connecting music to a video format, e.g. when songs are featured in movies, television and commercials.
