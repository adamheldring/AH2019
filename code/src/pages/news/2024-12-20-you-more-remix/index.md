### OUT NOW – Techno DJ Fredrik Liiv's remix of "You / More"

First time collaboration between indie-singer/songwriter Adam Heldring and techno-DJ and producer Fredrik Liiv. Growing up and coming of age in the shared hometown of Eskilstuna Sweden they rarely crossed paths due to genre borders and the split nature of their musical worlds. Liiv has built an eerie Twin Peaks-inspired soundscape around Heldring's fragile and naked voice and lyrics. Exploring and breaking new ground for both musicians.
